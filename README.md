# Project Description
Clubroom is an audio based social media application. This will be a new type of social product based on voice that allows people everywhere to talk, tell stories, develop ideas, deepen friendships and meet interesting people around the world. You can jump in and out of different chats, on different subjects like a free flowing podcast. You can simply listen or choose to throw in your thoughts.

## Motivation

Human beings are a social species, and communication can be vital in achieving any task we set out to do; the theme of our project is to make this communication easy, relevant, and convenient. So no matter who you are and what your interests may be, we want to help build a platform that gives you a voice to reach other people like you and help connect your ideas with the rest of the world.
